# Voorhoede Airhooks

Modern browsers provide a solid scripting foundation to build your web projects on. If you also need your project to stand firm in older browser you need Airhooks. 

Airhooks is a collection of JavaScript helpers using a wrapper around native and fallback methods rather than using polyfills. Zero dependencies. Just use whichever hooks you need.
  		
## Airhook format

* Name Airhooks after native methods in modern browsers.
* Name parameters same as in MDN documentation.
* Use UMD JS's amdWeb template.
* Use JSDoc for documentation.
